# os-config.terraform
Terraform module to create AWS resources

This is a work in progress project and is currently unfinished. In the end, it will be a way to automatically configure a newly installed operating system using the cloud with non-persistent resources, meaning that they will only be provisioned for the duration of the configuration. All details will be included in the wiki as the project progresses.
